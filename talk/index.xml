      <description>Representation learning has become an invaluable approach for learning from symbolic data such as text and graphs. However, while complex symbolic datasets often exhibit a latent hierarchical structure, state-of-the-art methods typically do not account for this property. In this talk, I will discuss a new approach for learning hierarchical representations of symbolic data by embedding them into hyperbolic space &amp;ndash; or more precisely into an n-dimensional Poincaré ball. Due to the underlying hyperbolic geometry, this allows us to learn parsimonious representations of symbolic data by simultaneously capturing hierarchy and similarity.</description>
