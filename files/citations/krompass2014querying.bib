abstract="An increasing amount of data is becoming available in the form of large triple stores, with the Semantic Web's linked open data cloud (LOD) as one of the most prominent examples. Data quality and completeness are key issues in many community-generated data stores, like LOD, which motivates probabilistic and statistical approaches to data representation, reasoning and querying. In this paper we address the issue from the perspective of probabilistic databases, which account for uncertainty in the data via a probability distribution over all database instances. We obtain a highly compressed representation using the recently developed RESCAL approach and demonstrate experimentally that efficient querying can be obtained by exploiting inherent features of RESCAL via sub-query approximations of deterministic views.",
