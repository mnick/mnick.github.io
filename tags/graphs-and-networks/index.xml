      <description>Representation learning has become an invaluable approach in machine learning and artificial intelligence. For instance, word embeddings such as word2vec, GloVe and fastText are widely used for tasks rangingfrom machine translation to sentiment analysis. Similarly, embeddings of (multi-)graphs such as RESCAL and node2vec have found important applications for learning in semantic and social networks.
In this project, we study a fundamental aspect of representation learning, i.e., the influence of the underlying geometry on embedding structured data.</description>
